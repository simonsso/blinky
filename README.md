# blinky

branch blinky:
I was not sufficiently happy with the way my tool set up the blinky (embedded hello world). It was over engineered and it did not indicate the correct way to setup the IO ports.

I replaced the elaborate bit by bit setup with a straightforward approach, setup the ports needed and all the direction bits. Write a good comment how it is done.

Illustrate both the ODR and toggle register.

branch 8x8:

use the same setup as in blinky to drive a 8x8 LED matrix connected on port A and port B
